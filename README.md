# covid-d3-visualization
As an exercise from a course with D3 in it's curriculum, I've got excited about it and built this visualization.
It should update day-by-day automatically (as long as the dataset is updated and available).
All the data is retrieved from here: https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/
## Note that to run it locally you'll need to use http-server.
Feel free to leave a feedback ;)
